# openid3-contract
core contract of OpenID3 implementations


## Verax Setup

To compile the project you will need to install verax contracts as your dependency.

The verax contracts are located at [here](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-attestation-registry/tree/dev/contracts). You will have to clone the repo to local and install the package by yourself.

The verax repo is built by forge so you will need to follow [the instruction here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) to install foundry and forge first.
